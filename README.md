## Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest
1. I would not use unit testing to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because this is a complex feature that involves writing and sending a message to another user. There are probably multiple interconnected functions, so comprehensive tests would have to test interactions between different components of the code, which unit testing is not for.
2. I would use unit testing to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because this feature is probably handled by a small and isolatable function, which makes it the perfect candidate for unit testing.
